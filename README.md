# Upload VMs from On-Premise to Cloud #

## Hands-On Lab ##

### Introduction ###

Hands-on labs are sets of step-by-step guides that are designed to help you learn how to use key Windows Azure services and features.  Each Lab provides instructions to guide you through the process of developing a complete application.

In this lab, you will upload an existing Hyper-V vhd-file from your **DC01** VM to Windows Azure. In this case, **DC01** represents the "on-premise" location. After the upload, the vhd-file can be used to create a new virtual machine in Windows Azure, or can be added as a data disk to an existing Azure virtual machine.

> **Note:** You can download the latest build of the Windows Azure Training Kit which includes a tested version of this HOL from here: http://bit.ly/WindowsAzureTK.
